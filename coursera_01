What Is a Peer-graded Assignment?
A peer-graded assignment is a task where students submit their work and then evaluate each other's submissions based on a rubric provided by the instructor. It’s common in online courses (like Coursera or edX) and helps develop critical thinking and feedback skills.

✅ Steps to Complete a Peer Review Assignment
1. Submit Your Own Work
Make sure your assignment is complete and follows the instructions.

Submit it before the deadline to unlock access to peer reviews.

2. Review the Rubric
Carefully read the grading criteria.

Understand what aspects you’re supposed to evaluate (e.g., clarity, completeness, originality).

3. Review Assigned Peers
You’ll usually be assigned 2–3 peer submissions.

Read each submission thoroughly.

4. Provide Constructive Feedback
Be respectful and specific.

Highlight strengths and suggest improvements.

Use examples from their work to support your comments.

5. Assign a Grade
Use the rubric to give a fair score.

Avoid bias—focus on the content and quality.

6. Submit Your Reviews
Double-check your feedback and scores.

Submit them before the review deadline.

💡 Tips for Giving Great Peer Feedback
Be objective: Focus on the work, not the person.

Be specific: “Your introduction is clear and sets up the topic well” is better than “Good job.”

Be helpful: Suggest ways to improve, not just what’s wrong.

Be kind: Encouraging feedback motivates learning.
